# malRansom
Python code that encrypts files in a user's home directory. IMPORTANT: In progress!
# Description
First, I would like to say this is for training purposes only and not to be used in any nefarious way. Definitely, 3rawm05nar.py is not a real 
sophisticated piece of code. The encryption file has only been tested on Linux and Windows 11. Windows takes longer to run the full script.
# Requirements
There are different ways to conjure up an upload server, but recommend installing the module "uploadserver" for python3. It is easy to use and allows you to
upload your key to you attack machine.
# Remember
IMPORTANT: Read the comments at the top of the python script. Update the Url for the uploading of the key and include port too.
# Python Upload Server
pip3 install uploadserver
Your machine - Example: python3 -m uploadserver 44444
